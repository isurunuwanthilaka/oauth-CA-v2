### Client Application v2 

This is the template for Spring Boot OAuth2.0 Client Application (CA)

* Integration with custom [Authorization Server](https://github.com/isurunuwanthilaka/oauth-AS-v2)

* Used `H2 database` for testing - all `sql` schemas included

* JWT Generation for secondary system

* This is a hybrid with `OAuth2.0` and `JWT`. `OAuth2` provides authentication for primary application and `JWT` provides authorization information for the secondary system
